# Writing an Interpreter in C  

This repository is my personal project where I follow the book [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. Instead of implementing the interpreter in Go, I have challenged myself to write it entirely in **C**.  

## Current Progress  
I have made significant progress, primarily focusing on the **parser**. While I haven't completed the interpreter yet, this repository reflects my learning process and the challenges I’ve encountered while adapting concepts from Go to C.  

### Key Features Implemented So Far  
- **Lexer**: Tokenizes input source code into meaningful tokens.  
- **Parser (Work in Progress)**: Parses the tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for further processing. (not entirely finished)  
- **Custom Hash Map**:  
  I’ve implemented my own **hash map** from scratch in C! This was a particularly rewarding challenge, as it deepened my understanding of data structures, memory management, and hash functions.  

## Why C?  
While the book uses Go, I chose C because I wanted to:  
- Deepen my understanding of low-level programming concepts.  
- Improve my skills in memory management and pointers.  
- Take on the challenge of implementing higher-level programming concepts in a low-level language.
